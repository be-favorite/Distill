## **Self-Introduction**
Hi, I'm a data scientist and researcher at [G-ABC](http://www.gilabc.com), where I [work](https://github.com/G-ABCwork) on evaluating health effects from long-term exposure to air pollution, statistical consulting, and other projects.

I fell in love with [`r fa(name = "r-project", fill = "#5F85A7")`](https://www.r-project.org/) and data science through my graduate research, using R and RStudio to wrangle, analyze, model, and visulize data. I became passionate about doing the R community and data science community, and involve in [Tidyverse Korea](https://www.facebook.com/groups/tidyverse) as one of the managers, and write light articles in [the sub-blog](https://statisticsplaybook.tistory.com/category/객원칼럼/be-favorite) of the Youtube channel <[Statistics Playbook](https://www.youtube.com/c/statisticsplaybook)> as one of the guest writers.

One of my goals for this year 2022 was to get out of my [Ex-blog](https://be-favorite.tistory.com) using Tistory, which is a blog platform in South Korea, and start personal blogging using Distill. I plan to move my previous writings diligently and actively post new ones. Please excuse that all contents in my blog are written in Korean. If you have any questions about writings in my blog, please feel free to comment on the post. I hope my blog helps you!
